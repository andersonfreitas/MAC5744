## Algoritmo 3D

1) Start with a regular octahedron centred around the origin (0,0,0), and the distance between the origin and each point is exactly 1.
2) For each triangle, replace with four triangles by adding additional points halfway along each edge of the triangle.
3) Move those new points away from the origin so that the distance from the origin is exactly one
